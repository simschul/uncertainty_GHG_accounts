\caption{Industry sectors for which our sample means are 
                  considerably (i.e. for more than 75\% of all regions) ABOVE 
                  the official EXIOBASE V3.8.2 estimate. Numeric values depict 
                  the median, 25\%-, and 75\%-Quantiles, respectively, 
                  of the sector-wise relative differences between our sample mean 
                  and the official EXIOBASE V3.8.2 estimate. A median of 19, 
                  for example, means that the median relative difference for 
                  that specific industry sector among all 49 regions is factor 
                  19 compared to the official EXIOBASE estimates. CO2 only.}
