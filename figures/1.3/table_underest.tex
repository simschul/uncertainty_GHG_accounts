\caption{Industry sectors for which our sample means are considerably 
  (i.e. for more than 75\% of all regions) BELOW the official EXIOBASE V3.8.2 
  estimate. Numeric values depict the median, 25\%-, and 75\%-Quantiles, 
  respectively, of the sector-wise relative differences between our sample mean 
  and the official EXIOBASE V3.8.2 estimate. A median of -0.9, for example, means
  that the median relative difference for that specific industry sector among
  all 49 regions is factor -0.9 compared to the official EXIOBASE estimates.
